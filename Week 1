"Batch" gradient descent

"Normal equation method" can directly, numerically solve for the minimum cost function J. But iterative methods still outperforms with large datasets.

ONE-index vectors are used in this course.

Non-square matrices (m-by-n matrices for which m â‰  n) do NOT have an inverse.
Matrices without inverses are called "singular" or "degenerate" matrices.
