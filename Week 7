SVM

	When using a kernel, DO perform feature scaling before using the kernel!
	(For charge sharing events analysis, we could: a. normalize the amplitude after subtraction by Cs-137 amplitude; b. normalize the transient amplitudes by the triggered signal amplitude then MULTIPLY BY, sqy, 5)
	Common kernels: linear (no) kernel; Gaussian kernel.
	Some other kernels: polynomial kernel, String kernel, chi-sqaure kernel, histogram...
	Note not all similarity functions can be used for SVM. They must satisfy "Mercer's Theorem"!
	Note 2: use "CROSS VALIDATION" to select the best kernel/C/theta!
	Neural network can mostly work well for problems that logistic regresssion and SVM work with, but it is slower.
	Also, an advantage of SVM is most of the time it is solving a convex problem in which there is only global optimum.
